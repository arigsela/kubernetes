# S3 Lifecycle Configuration for Loki Logs
# Automatically transitions logs to cheaper storage tiers over time
# This dramatically reduces storage costs while maintaining compliance
#
# Cost optimization strategy:
# - Days 0-30: STANDARD storage (hot data, frequently accessed)
# - Days 30-90: STANDARD_IA (infrequent access, 50% cheaper)
# - Days 90-365: DEEP_ARCHIVE (rarely accessed, 95% cheaper)
# - After 365 days: Deleted (retention policy compliance)
